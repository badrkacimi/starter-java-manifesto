So far Java was supporting the imperative style of programming and object-oriented style of programming. The next big thing what java has been added is that Java has started supporting the functional style of programming with its Java 8 release. In this article, we will discuss functional programming in Java 8. 

# What is functional programming? 
It is a declarative style of programming rather than imperative. The basic objective of this style of programming is to make code more concise, less complex, more predictable, and easier to test compared to the legacy style of coding. Functional programming deals with certain key concepts such as pure function, immutable state, assignment-less programming etc.
