So far Java was supporting the imperative style of programming and object-oriented style of programming. The next big thing what java has been added is that Java has started supporting the functional style of programming.

# In the imperative version
You tell the computer the steps you want it to perform in order to produce the result. If it gives the wrong result, is because your steps are wrong. In this particular case, the imperative version is a sequential scan over the list of people.

# In the declarative version
You tell the computer what you want, and the computer figures out the steps required to satisfy your requirements. The compiler or interpreter can choose to do a sequential scan, binary search, index scan, materialized views, or other algorithms. If it gives the wrong result is because you asked for the wrong thing.

# What is functional programming? 
It is a declarative style of programming rather than imperative. The basic objective of this style of programming is to make code more concise, less complex, more predictable, and easier to test compared to the legacy style of coding. Functional programming deals with certain key concepts such as pure function, immutable state, assignment-less programming etc.
